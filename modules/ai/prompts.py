1. "tech_stack": Identify all skills related to programming languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, and other technologies used in software development. Examples include Python, React.js, Node.js, Elasticsearch, Algolia, MongoDB, Spring Boot, .NET, etc.
2. "technical_skills": Capture skills related to technical expertise beyond specific tools, such as architectural design or specialized fields within engineering. Examples include System Architecture, Data Engineering, System Design, Microservices, Distributed Systems, etc.
3. "other_skills": Include non-technical skills like interpersonal, leadership, and teamwork abilities. Examples include Communication skills, Managerial roles, Cross-team collaboration, etc.
4. "required_skills": All skills specifically listed as required or expected from an ideal candidate. Include both technical and non-technical skills.
5. "nice_to_have": Any skills or qualifications listed as preferred or beneficial for the role but not mandatory.
Return the output in the following JSON format with no additional commentary:
